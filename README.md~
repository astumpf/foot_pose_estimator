# Multi contact point foot pose estimator

The pose estimator makes a prediction of how a foot stands on uneven terrain, where the foot shape can be non-convex.

The framework contains three approaches to estimate the pose and one approach to calculate the pose deterministically using a non-convex hull algorithm.

The best approach, the multi-contact-point-estimator is then implemented in ROS to make a path planning simulation.

## Generate training data in Matlab

## Train a model in Python with Tensorflow

## Compile a library to load and run the trained model file in other projects

## Implementation is ROS to run a path planning simulation using the model
