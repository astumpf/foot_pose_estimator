The lib_tensorflow_model_run.so library loads a tensorflow model file,
holds it in a session and allows to make predictions with this specific model.

This library can be used in other projects for example in ROS to make predictions
without the need to include other tensorflow sourcecode into the project.

To compile it you need to have tensorflow installed. More information can be found here:

To start the build process:
jan@pc1404:~/tftest/tensorflow/tensorflow/loader$ bazel build :lib_tensorflow_model_run.so

after the build process the lib_tensorflow_model_run.so file is in
~/tftest/tensorflow/bazel-bin/tensorflow/loader

Finally include the .so file and the header into your project.

(if you need to run the model without GPU support you have to ./configure bazel accordingly)
