The lib_multi_contact_point_model.so library loads a tensorflow model file,
holds it in a session and allows to make predictions with this specific model.

This library can be used in other projects for example in ROS to make predictions
without the need to include other tensorflow sourcecode into the project.

To compile it you need to have tensorflow installed. Create the folder "loader" (or a different name) in tensorflow/tensorflow and copy the files of this folder (cpp_tensorflow_run_model_lib) into the loader folder.

For the first time you need to configure bazel (./configure) and activate or deactivate GPU support.

To start the build process:
jan@pc1404:~/tensorflow/tensorflow/loader$ bazel build :lib_multi_contact_point_model.so

After the build process the lib_multi_contact_point_model.so file is in
~/tensorflow/bazel-bin/tensorflow/loader

Finally include the .so file and the header (multi_contact_point_model_run_lib.h) into your project.

In ROS include the library path in the CMakeLists.txt for example like this
## Specify libraries to link a library or executable target against
target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME} ${catkin_LIBRARIES} ${boost_LIBRARIES} ${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/tensorflow/lib/lib_multi_contact_point_model.so)

(if you need to run the model without GPU support you have to ./configure bazel accordingly)
